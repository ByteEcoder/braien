# Braien - Secure Browsing

Braien is a secure browsing solution that provides a safe and private web experience. It gives users access to multiple browsers like Firefox and Tor within isolated containers on our website. After closing the container, it automatically deletes all digital footprints, unlike traditional browsers which save cookies and other tracking data. Braien is designed to protect users from various online threats, including malware, phishing attacks, and data breaches.
